In particular, exposure to solar radiation may be involved in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Melanoma is more common in fair-skinned individuals and most frequent in skin sites exposed to the sun. In white populations melanoma is more common in areas closer to the equator where the intensity of solar radiation is higher. Data from various parts of the world suggest that the incidence of melanoma is increasing. The data below, giving age-adjusted melanoma incidence, are from the Connecticut Tumor Registry from 1936-1972. Connecticut has the longest record of state population-based cancer statistics in the United States of America. The data also includes the sunspot relative number. Houghton, Munster and Viola (1978) have shown that the age-adjusted incidence rate for malignant melanoma in the state of Connecticut has risen since 1935 and that superimposed on the rise are 3-5 year periods in which the rise in the rate of incidence is excessive. These periods have a cycle of 8-11 years and follow times of maximum sunspot activity. The relationship between solar cycles and melanoma supports the hypothesis that melanoma is related to sun exposure and provides evidence that solar radiation may trigger the development of clinically apparent melanoma.","category":"page"},{"location":"Examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"The data can be obtained through the following helper function","category":"page"},{"location":"Examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"get_sunspot_melanoma_data","category":"page"},{"location":"Examples/#AsymptoticPDC.get_sunspot_melanoma_data","page":"Examples","title":"AsymptoticPDC.get_sunspot_melanoma_data","text":"get_sunspot_melanoma_data()\n\nThis data is from Andrews and Herzberg.
